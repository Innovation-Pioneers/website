  title: How to use POP?
  text: The traditional methods are a hassle to use, the trays and bags
    impractical and troublesome to fill, freeze, and not least serve. ICEBREAKER
    is the new way of making ice cubes. With the ICEBREAKER technology, we want
    to make ice cubes available to all people around the world and make ice
    cubes that extra affordable luxury in our everyday life.

  text: Just like you and everyone else – we at ICEBREAKER Nordic love to get ice
    cubes in our drinks – whether in the private setting of everyday life, or at
    more social get-togethers, parties, picnics, etc. None of the existent
    solutions are simple, efficient, or particularly user-friendly – and,
    certainly, the current disposable solution is far from being environmentally
    conscious.
