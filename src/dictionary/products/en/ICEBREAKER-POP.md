  title: How to use POP?
  text: The traditional methods are a hassle to use, the trays and bags impractical and troublesome to fill, freeze, and not least serve. ICEBREAKER is the new way of making ice cubes.

  text: Just like you and everyone else – we at ICEBREAKER Nordic love to get ice cubes in our drinks – whether in the private setting of everyday life, or at more social get-togethers, parties, picnics, etc. None of the existent solutions are simple, efficient, or particularly user-friendly – and, certainly, the current disposable solution is far from being environmentally conscious.
